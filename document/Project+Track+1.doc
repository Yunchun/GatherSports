    <h1>Project Track 1</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <h2 id=3D"ProjectTrack1-Section1:ProjectIntroduction">Section 1: Pr=
oject Introduction</h2>
<p>This project aims to provide an opportunity for students to apply relati=
onal database techniques to a domain of the student=E2=80=99s choice. Stude=
nts will be asked to create a&nbsp;relational (SQL) database-centric&nbsp;w=
eb-based application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students form teams of 4; the team formation process is outlined in the =
next section. Students are required to complete this group work in stages. =
We clarify the requirements for each stage in section 3. Project policies a=
re listed in section 4. Please read the following sections carefully. Rubri=
cs are also provided in each section. In addition, to clarify some question=
s you might have, we will keep an updated list of Q&amp;A (grouped by stage=
s) in section 4.</p>
<p>It is <u><strong>strongly recommended</strong></u> that you read the <u>=
<strong>entire</strong></u>&nbsp;document so you have an idea of what is co=
ming up.</p>
<h2 id=3D"ProjectTrack1-Section2:Teamformation">Section 2: Team formation</=
h2>
<p>Students should form teams of exactly four members (no more, no less). O=
nly teams formed by the teaching staff may have 3 members. No team should h=
ave more than 4 members.</p>
<p>Students should register their teams by the stage 0 deadline by submitti=
ng their team formation information to this&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://forms.g=
le/s1TwgY72vsBFHF8N7" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">google form<=
/a>. If students did not join a team by the stage 0 deadline, the course st=
aff will randomly assign them to groups. The following are some team format=
ion policies that students need to be aware of.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Each team must have 4 members, no more, no less. Groups must fill up=
 spaces if a student drops the course before the team formation time elapse=
s.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a team of less than 4, you can still submit the&nbsp;<a =
href=3D"https://forms.gle/s1TwgY72vsBFHF8N7" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D=
"nofollow">google form</a>. After the stage 0 deadline, the course staff wi=
ll fill the empty slots by randomly assigning students to your team.</p></l=
i>
<li><p>If you did not join a team by the Stage 0 deadline, do not worry, th=
e course staff will randomly assign you to a team. You will receive your te=
am information via email.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>All teams must have a team captain. The team captain acts as the mai=
n point of contact between the team and the course staff.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Students in the same group must all be in the same discussion sessio=
n for group assignments. Students that do not satisfy the requirements to b=
e in the evening session would not be granted to move to the evening sessio=
n. However, students in the evening session are allowed to attend the morni=
ng session. Students cannot switch between sessions during the semester unl=
ess otherwise approved by the teaching staff. These requirements are listed=
 on the course syllabus.</p></li>
<li><p>Please feel free to reach out to course staff if you have any questi=
ons.</p></li>

<h2 id=3D"ProjectTrack1-Section3:StagesandRubrics(Fullmark:100%)">Section 3=
: Stages and Rubrics (Full mark: 100%)</h2>
<p>In this project, you will develop a relational database-centric web appl=
ication. We will use the terms =E2=80=9Cdatabase=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Crela=
tional database=E2=80=9D interchangeably in the remainder of the document.&=
nbsp;</p>
<p>Each project stage is&nbsp;due at 23:59 pm (CDT) on the specified due da=
te. The submission time would be based on the wiki page update time or the =
GitHub commit time, whichever is relevant to the task. Your group is expect=
ed to submit each stage's required materials to your project homepage (and/=
or Github). The details are found under each stage. Forgetting to update yo=
ur project page with a link to the new documents will not receive a grade f=
or that part. Please follow the submission instructions carefully.&nbsp;&nb=
sp;</p>
<p>Here is a high-level summary of what the stages would be:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 0: Team Formation (2%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stage 1: Project description (8%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stage 2: Conceptual and Logical Database Design (15%)</strong></=
p>
<p><strong>Stage 3: Database design and Indexing (22%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stage 4: Midterm Demo (20%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stage 5: Final Demo (23%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stage 6: Report and video (10%)</strong></p>
<h2 id=3D"ProjectTrack1-Stage0:TeamFormation(2%)">Stage 0: Team Formation (=

oogle form</a>&nbsp;before the deadline listed. 1 point deduction would be =
applied to the stage if the form was not submitted on time.</p></li>
<li><p>After submitting the team formation Google form, each group must cre=
ate its project page:</p></li>

</li>
<li><p>You will create your project page and name it with the title "Projec=

 the team number. This will be the homepage for your project.</p></li>

<p>The team captain is responsible to keep track of the progress of all mem=

t is a great experience that teaches you how to manage a team.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rubric:&nbsp;</strong>This stage is worth 2%. You are graded by =
completeness. To be complete, you should have all the components listed bel=

<p>In the previous stages, we designed all the database components for our =
application. Now it is time to connect your database to the front-end appli=
cation. For this stage, your team is expected to build a simple user interf=
ace that interacts with the database you developed in Stage 3. Please note =
that we do not grade based on how fancy your user interface is. We grade ba=
sed on the functionality of your interface and how it connects to the datab=
ase.</p>
<p><strong>As a team, you should</strong>&nbsp;create a simple user interfa=
ce that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and search operations =
on the table(s) you created in stage 3. You must implement each operation a=
t least once (5+ operations: CRUD &amp; Search) and they can&nbsp;each be o=
n different tables. Try to make the interfaces and operations relevant to y=
our application! The expected functions along with their rubric are listed =
below.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Insert new records (rows) to the database (3%):</p></li>
<ol>
<li><p>0% if no interface for this operation is present</p></li>
<li><p>+0.5% for having the code connecting the interface with the database=
</p></li>
<li><p>+ 1.5% for having the interface for insertion</p></li>
<li><p>+1% for successfully inserting to the database</p></li>
</ol>
<li><p>Search the database using a keyword search. Your application should =
allow the user to input their search keyword and return the result to the i=
