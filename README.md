## GatherSports

GATHERSPORTS is an application developed for CS 411 Database System taken for my Master of Computer Science degree at UIUC. This platform is a sports experience system that connects sports mates with similar sports interests, so that people have more incentives to exercise. This application supports users to perform the following actions: 
(a) register and login to the system
(b) update own profile information individually
(c) match and connect to sport mates with similar hobbies
(d) make and delete court reservations to play sports
(e) make and delete coach appointments to get in-person practices
(f) enroll in interested courses
(g) send out messages in the system
By offering these functionalities, we hope our application can motivate people to exercise, live a healthier lifestyle, and relax themselves from pressure of work or study
