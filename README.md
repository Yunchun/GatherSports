## Introduction

GatherSports is an application developed for CS 411 Database System taken for my Master of Computer Science degree at UIUC. This platform is a sports experience system that connects sports mates with similar sports interests, helps with court reservation, and supports online course registration. Therefore, people have more incentives to exercise.
